*TL;DR: Are you an introvert? Do you feel awkward among people you don't know or in crowds? I have tested a strategy for you!*

Introverts gain energy by spending time alone or with small groups of close friends, whereas extroverts thrive on social interaction. Being an introvert does not necessarily mean being shy, but rather that social interactions can be a challenge, especially among large groups of unknown people.

Now, in the tech world, networking is a game-changer. It's the key to scoring jobs, boosting your career, or just connecting with awesome people who share your passions. By meeting new people and building relationships, you'll be able to expand your professional network. These connections can be your ticket to job opportunities, referrals, and business growth. Sure, tech is moving at warp speed (especially with all that AI hype), but guess what? Networking is still the ace up your sleeve for staying in the know.

So, how can you network as an introvert? Social scenes might not be your natural habitat, and networking does not come naturally... But that does not mean it's not possible, just something you can work on. Below, you'll find 10 strategies that I have tried and worked for me.

### Join online communities

If the thought of face-to-face interaction gives you the jitters, find local communities on platforms like Slack and start networking online! You can also start with social networks - reacting to tech communications is easy and will enable you to spark conversations.

Digital networking lets you ease into the social vibe at your own pace. So, whether you're typing away in a virtual Slack corner or leaving comments on tech updates, you're still building those connections, just with a bit more bandwidth and fewer in-person butterflies.

### Attend meetups and conferences

This is, for me, the second obvious step. Finding meetups is an easy task: check out [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) for local groups or conference aggregators such as [DevEvents](https://dev.events/) and [Confs.tech](https://confs.tech).
Attending the conference itself? Not the tricky part... The real challenge? You've got to mingle and network, which means actually talking to people. Cue the introvert dilemma!

### Do your homework before the event

For meetups or small events, you might be lucky to have an attendee list. If not, dive into social media with hashtags or handles to scout out the crowd. The goal? Find several people that you know or that you might have something in common with (someone who worked at your current company) and memorize their faces and names. This will allow you to spot people in the crowd and easily engage in conversation. Try a casual opener like "Hey! We might not have crossed paths, but I think we both worked at ThisGreatCompany?" or "Hi, if I am not mistaken, you are a ThisGreatProject contributor? That's awesome!", or even on a more personal level: "Hey, I think we both know ThisGreatPerson, have you had any news recently?"

No, no, we're not talking about stalking here – just preparation to keep the conversation flowing.

### Engage in conversation as much as possible: break the ice!

It might seem like a no-brainer, but here's the scoop - it's actually the important part. Software conferences and meetups are full of like-minded introverts. Engage in conversation with the person sitting next to you: they are attending the same conference, finding a common topic of interest should not be too hard! 
I find it easier to first start with something like "mind if I sit here?" and then continue with something like "are you also working on topic X?" rather than just bluntly talking about tech topics.

Feeling awkward speaking to strangers? Well, that stranger is likely to be an introvert too, and you might be doing them a favor by taking the initiative to spark the conversation.

### Talk to speakers and build personal connections

Here's a pro-tip that's a bit of a cakewalk: speakers are practically waiting for someone like you to chat them up after their talk. And to make it even easier, the topic of conversation is a no-brainer!

Rather than firing away during the Q&A session, I find it more effective to ask my questions face-to-face. Why? Because the connection is more personal. You're not just another face in the crowd – you're the person they chatted with about that intriguing point or burning question, and you can build on that later on (see the next point!)

Bonus part here: it's your chance to genuinely thank them for their time and effort. Trust me, this is always much appreciated!

### Continue the conversation during break times

Navigating lunch and breaks during conferences can be a bit like stepping into uncharted territory. The good news: it's also a golden opportunity.

That's where your connections from the previous steps become useful: you've got a list of potential lunch buddies or break partners – people you've already broken the ice with.

It's also the time to have longer conversations and talk about more meaningful topics. Encourage people to share their stories, passions, and experiences. Show genuine interest, listen intently, and watch those connections turn into something substantial. 

### Recharge and reset: take breaks for personal space

Alright, let's talk survival strategy at conferences. I'm with you on this one – sometimes you just need a breather. My go-to move? Hunt down a quiet spot, be it an empty conference room, a peaceful corner, or even take a walk outside, and take a few minutes to just breathe. Conferences can be a whirlwind, and it's totally okay to step out for a bit of solo time. It's not about avoiding the action; it's about recharging your batteries so you can dive back in.

Prioritize those short breaks to keep your energy levels up and the conference vibes positive.

### Part of a minority? Empower yourself

Being part of a minority brings its own set of dynamics, and finding community members is also a great way to feel more secure. From my standpoint, connecting with other women who can share their experiences has been incredibly valuable. Sharing experiences, challenges, and victories with others who understand your unique perspective can be both empowering and reassuring. So, if you're a minority in your field, seek out those who share your journey – it's not just about networking; it's about building a support system that understands and uplifts you.

### Become a speaker

Here's a twist you might not have seen coming: introverts taking the stage. Strange, right? Surprisingly, I have found that many introverts (including myself) are more comfortable speaking in front of a large audience rather than tackling group dynamics. Giving talks skips the need for small talk, and people come to you (see point 5). No need to break the ice; it's already cracked.

So, if the idea of navigating those small-group waters feels a bit overwhelming, consider stepping onto the stage. It's a different kind of introvert-friendly networking that puts you in control and lets your words do the talking.

### Practice makes (networking) perfect

Here's the golden rule to wrap it all up: none of these steps happen overnight. It's a journey, not a sprint. Some steps might feel a bit out of your comfort zone initially, but with practice, they become second nature.

I found myself striking up a conversation with a total stranger on a 4-hour train ride. A year ago, that wouldn't have happened. But hey, this year of networking practice had some unexpected and downright fun side-effects.

Take your time, be patient with yourself, and let each connection-building experience be a stepping stone. With a bit of practice, you'll be a networking maestro, turning once-awkward moments into opportunities for growth and genuine connections.
