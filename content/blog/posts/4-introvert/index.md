*TL;DR: Are you an introvert? Do you feel awkward among people you don't know or in crowds? I have tested a strategy for you!*

Introverts gain energy by spending time alone or with small groups of close friends, whereas extroverts thrive on social interaction. Being an introvert doesn't necessarily mean being shy, but rather that social interactions can be draining, especially among large groups of people you don't know.

In tech, networking matters. It's how you find jobs, grow your career, and connect with people who share your interests. Meeting new people and building relationships expands your professional network. These connections can lead to job opportunities, referrals, and business growth. Tech moves fast, but networking is still one of the most effective ways to stay current and connected.

So, how can you network as an introvert? Social scenes might not be your natural habitat, and networking doesn't come naturally. But that doesn't mean it's impossible. Here are 10 strategies I've tested that worked for me.

### Join online communities

If face-to-face interaction makes you uncomfortable, start with online communities on platforms like Slack. You can also use social networks - reacting to tech posts is easy and can lead to conversations.

Digital networking lets you ease in at your own pace. Whether you're in a Slack channel or leaving comments on tech updates, you're still building connections, just without the in-person pressure.

### Attend meetups and conferences

This is the second step. Finding meetups is easy: check out [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) for local groups or conference aggregators like [DevEvents](https://dev.events/) and [Confs.tech](https://confs.tech).

Attending the conference isn't the hard part. The challenge is actually talking to people. That's the introvert dilemma.

### Do your homework before the event

For meetups or small events, you might get an attendee list. If not, check social media with event hashtags or handles to see who's going. The goal is to find a few people you know or have something in common with (like someone who worked at your company) and remember their faces and names. This makes it easier to spot them and start a conversation. You can open with something like "Hey! I think we both worked at ThisGreatCompany?" or "Hi, are you a ThisGreatProject contributor?" or even "Hey, I think we both know ThisGreatPerson, have you heard from them recently?"

This is just preparation to make conversations easier.

### Engage in conversation as much as possible: break the ice

This is the important part. Software conferences and meetups are full of introverts like you. Talk to the person sitting next to you - they're at the same conference, so finding a common topic shouldn't be hard.

I find it easier to start with something like "mind if I sit here?" and then "are you also working on topic X?" rather than jumping straight into tech.

Feeling awkward? That stranger is probably an introvert too, and you might be doing them a favor by starting the conversation.

### Talk to speakers and build personal connections

Speakers are usually happy to chat after their talk, and the topic of conversation is obvious.

Instead of asking questions during Q&A, I find it more effective to ask face-to-face afterwards. The connection is more personal. You're not just another face in the crowd - you're someone they had a real conversation with, and you can build on that later.

Bonus: it's your chance to thank them for their time and effort. This is always appreciated.

### Continue the conversation during break times

Lunch and breaks can feel awkward, but they're also opportunities to connect.

This is where your earlier connections help: you have people you've already talked to who you can grab lunch or coffee with.

It's the time for longer conversations about more meaningful topics. Ask people about their work, interests, and experiences. Show genuine interest, listen, and those connections can become real relationships. 

### Recharge and reset: take breaks for personal space

Sometimes you just need a break. Find a quiet spot - an empty conference room, a corner, or go outside for a walk. Take a few minutes to breathe. Conferences are exhausting, and it's okay to step out for solo time. It's not about avoiding people; it's about recharging so you can continue.

Take those short breaks to keep your energy up.

### Part of a minority? Empower yourself

Being part of a minority brings its own challenges, and finding community members can help you feel more secure. For me, connecting with other women who share their experiences has been valuable. Sharing experiences, challenges, and successes with others who understand your perspective can be empowering and reassuring. If you're a minority in your field, seek out those who share your journey - it's about building a support system.

### Become a speaker

This might sound counterintuitive, but many introverts (including myself) are more comfortable speaking in front of a large audience than navigating small group dynamics. Giving talks means you don't need small talk, and people come to you afterwards. The ice is already broken.

If small-group conversations feel overwhelming, consider speaking. It's a different kind of networking that puts you in control.

### Practice makes (networking) perfect

None of these steps happen overnight. Some will feel uncomfortable at first, but with practice, they get easier.

I recently found myself striking up a conversation with a stranger on a 4-hour train ride. A year ago, that wouldn't have happened. This year of networking practice had some unexpected side-effects.

Take your time, be patient with yourself, and let each experience be a learning opportunity. With practice, awkward moments become easier to handle and can turn into genuine connections.
