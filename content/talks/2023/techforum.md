## Abstract

Is AI really useful today, or just a hype ? And in the future, will AI replace developers ? Will software engineers become prompt engineers ? From Github Copilot to ChatGPT, the latest AI news have shaken the software world... and us, at Worldline. We have seen during the last year many initiatives at our company around this subject, and it is time to share them with you. By the end of this talk, you will have a good idea of the current status of AI for software engineering and the AI augmented software developer, and finally, some insights on how will AI impact us in the future.
