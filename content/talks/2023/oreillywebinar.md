## Abstract

Everyone wants to build their own state-of-the-art chatbot. But even ChatGPT's limits are exposed when it’s unable to answer questions using the most recent information. What’s great about the ChatGPT API is that it allows you to build a solution with your own data. Olivier Caelen and Marie-Alice Blete help you understand why and when to use the ChatGPT API, covering both its benefits and potential use cases. You’ll explore architectures and best practices for implementation and learn how to teach ChatGPT to answer questions from a PDF. Olivier and Marie-Alice will also discuss how their roles as software engineers and data scientists are evolving with these new technologies and examine future trends and implications for the field of AI and chatbots.
