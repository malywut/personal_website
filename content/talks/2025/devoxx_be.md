## Abstract

... or at least come to this talk before to learn more about our wins and our face-palms.

At Komodo Health, we provide the most complete and unbiased map of the US patient journey. In this talk, I'll explain how our approach to agentic systems allows us to deliver in-depth patient insights and answer complex analytical questions that were previously impossible.

You'll get a real look at what a production project actually looks like - not another Hello World tutorial. We'll walk through the product vision, technical implementation, and user feedback, and by the end of this talk you'll have a clear 360 view of what you need to build your own agentic system. What would you bet on being the hardest part: the hallucinations, the immature frameworks, or the constantly evolving tech?
Spoiler alert: it is none of those... maybe.

But honestly, what happens when you combine agentic AI with healthcare data? Magic!
