## Abstract

Buckle up, we are about to embark on a journey through human-computer interaction. Remember the good old days of graphical interfaces and mice? Hold on to your keyboards because weâ€™re living in the age of the second revolution: natural language interaction.

In this presentation, we will take a simple but hands-on example to illustrate three different ways of building an AI agent: mainly prompts, combining prompts and code, and LangChain agents. We will see the pros and cons of each implementation.

By the end of this talk, you'll be equipped to start your own explorations in agentic AI!
