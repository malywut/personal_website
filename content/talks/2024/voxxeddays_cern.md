## Abstract

Buckle up, we are about to embark on a journey through human-computer interaction. Remember the good old days of graphical interfaces and mice? Hold on to your keyboards because we're living in the age of the second revolution: natural language interaction.

Join me in this presentation where we'll unleash the power of natural language interaction by turning a boring application into a fantastical LLM-powered app. Wave goodbye to those buttons, filters, and navigation panels because we're about to rewrite the user interface rulebook! We'll demystify the process by starting from the basics— a quick recap' of LLM principles, followed by a first solution using the OpenAI API. We will then go on to use agents with the remarkable LangChain framework in a second solution.

By the end of this talk, you'll be armed with all the knowledge you need to build your own LLM-powered applications. You will also have a list of tricks, tips, and a good idea of the pitfalls related to working with LLMs.
